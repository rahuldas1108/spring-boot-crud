Hello!!

Git Stash:-

    For example:- A change in made on a particular branch and another developer has commited a change in the same branch. Use git stash to save the chnages made into a temporary stack. Now git status wont show any odification on that branch because the chanes are in stack.
            Then take a git pull and then do git stash pop, this will pull the changes from the temp stack and will add over te latest git pull. If there is a conflict, plz resolve the same.

Scenario: Need to create a jar to deploy from a older commit of main branch

    git checkout main //checkout the main branch
    git checkout <commit_no> // this will checkout the particular commit no. code
